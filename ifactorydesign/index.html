                There's more visual freedom in parallax website design.Rather
                than focusing on block style information architecture, you can
                create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or
                beautiful photography , that act as animations or beautiful
                photography,that act as a continnum,ultimately inspiriong users
                to scroll fiurther down the page

                Do you want to tell a story with your product or
                service?LOng-scrolling lends itself well toa narrative and
                encourages meaningful interaction from users.

              <h1>simple interface for smart device users</h1>
              <p>
                Mobile and tablets have evolved the way we engage in
                websites.it's now less about clicking and more about scrolling
                swiping and tapping.Long-scrollin websites take away the barrier
                of complex navigation,providing a responsive,user-friendly
                experience for mobile users.

                Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
                website browsers,as it forces business to convey their message
                and vision into one dynamic web design page.

              <h1>faster for users to realise their goals</h1>
              <p>
                These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an
                instimctive action,Whereas clicking through to another page
                requires thoughtand motivation.A single page website allows user
                to identify their purpose no the website quicker, than needing
                to sift through multiple pages.

              <p>You need to be search engine savvy</p>
              <p>
                One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
                hey are not Seo friendly.Why?When you limit the number of pages
                on your website,Google has fewer pages to index and negatively
                impactssyour standing on the search engine results
                page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this

            <div class="inner-content">
              <h1>slower load times</h1>
              <p>
                50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in
                3-5seconds.So the more high resolution imagery and animations
                you include ,the longer itr takes to load page.When writing
                article,we tested some popular parallax websites,and found that
                the one with complex visuals took upto 30 seconds to load ona
                mobile device,whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites
                loaded within a few seconds

              <h1>awkward navigation</h1>
              <p>
                Instead of hitting the "back" button,users must scroll back up
                the page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer
                back toa certain element.An easy way around this is to include
                top navigation and have each element anchored to a category or
                section
